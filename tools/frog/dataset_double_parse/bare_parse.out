Points of attention:
senctence 3300 has an "'e" as in "me'e'r'", see what happened to the sentence (dropped and shifting all sentences up), or just a bad parse?




Output when (incorectly) runnin frog on "sent_id|Sentence..", and with the tokenizer enabled (should be off)
(ie. with garabage tokens attached to the front of each sentence)
